# Dynatrace Test Automation Plugin

Integration of Dynatrace within your TFS/VSTS build. 

Dynatrace can instrument the Unit and Integration tests and does the Test Automation APM magic: [Test Automation Explained] 

The results flow back to your TFS/VSTS build. You can even configure this extension to fail your build when Dynatrace detects regression issues.

> **Note:** The instrumentation itself is not covered by this extension.
